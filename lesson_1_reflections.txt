How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u game_old.js game_new.js

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    detecting bugs, restoring previous versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    when a change in logical block of even small size is completed. too many commits and to infrequent commit, both could create problems.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because we can change multiple files at once and those may be higly interdependent when we talk about code. tracking them individually and mannually checking the closest commit may be a problem.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log --stat || git diff commit#1 commit#2. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always trac the changes and revert back the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control!
